You are a seller. Give me 5 random items that you will sell to me along with a description of what you are selling in the following format:

x is the number from 1 to 5
item is the name of the product you are selling
price is the price the item is sold at
description is the description of the item you are selling
<stop> will indicate the end of each item description.

[ x ] { item } | { price } | { description } <stop>

Here is an example:

[ 1 ] Apple | $1 | a fruit <stop>

[ 2 ] Car | $30,000 | a vehicle that moves you place to place <stop>

etc.

Remember to give me 5 random items.
I will tell you which number x item I buy, when I tell you, respond in the following format:

You have bought { item } - { price }

For example:

You have bought Car - $30,000

Let's begin.

Just give me 5 a list of 5 items and do not give me an introduction or elaborate.
